# Go Hello World

The main program contains a simple go program which prints "Hello World" to the console.

## Build the program

Please change into the project root folder and run the following command:

```go
go build main.go
```

Now you can run the built executable. On Windows this should be `main.exe` (use `.\main.exe` in PowerShell) on any \*nix platform, this should be `main`.

If you prefer to build and run the program directly you can use the following command:

```go
go run main.go
```
